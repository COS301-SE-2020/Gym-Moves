	Read me V1.0 - 21/9 - 2009


	Thank you for downloading Lastwaerk!

If you like Lastwaerk and use it, you are very welcome to leave a donation!
Making fonts is much work and even a very small amount of money will be highly appreciated, encouraging me to keep making fonts available free of charge.  
To make a donation, use the link "donate" included in the Lastwaerk folder.

(Note that it is entirely up to you if you want to leave a donation, and not doing so should by no means morally stop you from using Lastwaerk)



	To install:

Windows:
Copy the font files to C:\windows\fonts

Mac:
Put the files into /Library/Fonts (for all users), or into /Users/Your_username/Library/Fonts (for you only).

Linux:
Copy the font files to fonts:// in the File manager

NOTE: If you only want some of the weights, simply leave out the ones you don't want when copying the files to the font folder.


I hope you will enjoy using it.

This means, that you can share the font as you like, but not make a new version of the font (e.g. a condensed version) and publish it without my permission. Other than that, you are free to use it as you like in any way (mix it with other fonts/ change letters etc. etc.)

If you still have questions or comments, you can write to my email: aajohan@gmail.com
You are also very welcome to show me how you've used the font, as part of the joy creating a font lies in seeing it being used.
