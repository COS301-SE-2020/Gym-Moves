# Gym-Moves

Gym Moves is an application that will make life easier for gym members and gym staff. The application will allow users to see the number of people currently at the gym, the classes that have been cancelled, and information about the gym. This will include promotions and maintenance announcements which will be added by the gym's staff members. This will allow members to make an informed decision about visiting the gym. This project is being developed by the Lockdown Squad.

I am a final year Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. I chose to study computer science not only because I enjoy coding but also because of the problem solving aspect of it. Every day I am exposed to a new problem and a thousand ways to approach and solve it. This degree has helped me improve my ability to react to change, pressure and learn on the job. All in all I have become a better coder and student and I now appreciate lifelong learning.
