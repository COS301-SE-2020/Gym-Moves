# Gym-Moves

<!-- Description must be added here -->
Gym Moves is an application that will make life easier for gym members and gym staff. The application will allow users to see the number of people currently at the gym, the classes that have been cancelled, and information about the gym. This will include promotions and maintenance announcements which will be added by the gym's staff members. This will allow members to make an informed decision about visiting the gym. This project is being developed by the Lockdown Squad.

I am a final year Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. I consider myself extremely hardworking and dedicated when it comes to my work. I am very results-oriented, I always try to make sure all my goals I have set are achieved. I have good problem-solving skills, as my degree has helped me build and improve on them. I am always ready and eager to learn and develop new skills. My degree has taught me how to adapt to changing environments. I have also been able to develop my team work skills as there has been many instances where I have had to do group projects.

I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. I first started coding in 2015 where I tried making plugins for the game Minecraft. I enjoy learning new things and finding ways to solve problems. I enjoy working in groups and we've had many group projects where I have had the opportunity to develop my teamwork skills. I always try to accomplish goals that I have set for myself, although it may be difficult at times.

I'm persuing my third year of BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. I've always had a passion for coding, mathematics and problem solving. Even though the degree is tough, I do enjoy the challenge as it keeps me on my feet. I learn new things every single day, and try to give my all in everything I do. I've been put in many team projects this year, and it really helped me to grow and develop new skills, which I am grateful for.
